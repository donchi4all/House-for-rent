Class Lab #5 – House for rent (5%) 
 
The application should give the customer the ability to select the type of house; number of beds and baths in a house to rent.   
 
Use the PropertyClasses Class Library from your previous lab as an integral part of this project. You should add a new class. Call it Property. You may need to make some changes to your Rent class.  
 
You can also download and open the starting point for this project from Week 5 in BlackBoard. It includes class library which contains a Buyer class. The form has been designed with space where shown above. Remember we’ll be adding more to this application. 
 
Use Constants for fixed values (bed price, bath price, town base price, semi-detached base price and detached base price).  Use appropriate data types. 
 
- Each bedroom costs $300. (No consideration for room size) 
- Each full bathroom costs $75. However, cost cuts to half if you choose half bath - Base Price for town house, Semi-detached and Detached is $500, $700 and $1000 respectively. 
 
The Form should calculate the rent based on their selections.  Once the customer has finished making their selections, a final summary of the house with type, total rent and customer full name should display in the label in the bottom right of the form called lblDisplayRent.  
 
- Rename the form title with your student name.
-     Follow a naming convention for all controls, variables, and constants.  
-     Disable 4 rooms radiobutton if customer wants a town house. 
-     Create only one object (Rent) in Form1.cs.
